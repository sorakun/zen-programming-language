This document provides guidelines on how to build Zen binaries on several
platforms.

>> Microsfot Windows:
This package comes along with a CodeBlocks workspace, which contains 2 projects,
Zen for Windows, and Zen for Linux, just compile the Zen for Windows project,
and everything shall workfine. If you wish to use your own IDE, then just 
add all the files in the "src" directory and the sub-directories, except
"adllin.c".

>> Linux/Unix systems:
This package comes along with a CodeBlocks workspace, which contains 2 projects,
Zen for Windows, and Zen for Linux, just compile the Zen for Linux project,
and everything shall workfine. If you wish to use your own IDE, then just 
add all the files in the "src" directory and the sub-directories, except
"adlwin.c".

>> Apple MacOS X:
Not tested, but should work fine by compiling the Linux version, and defining 
"ZEN_MAC_OSX" in Zen.h
If you want to help us trying Zen on MAC, please contact us.
